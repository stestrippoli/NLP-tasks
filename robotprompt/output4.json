 "question": "Take the bottle over the robotics desk and place it to the metaverse desk after passing to the mobility desk.",
 "answer": [
  "[Navigation:robotics_desk, Grasp:bottle, Navigation:mobility_desk, Place, Navigation:metaverse_desk]",
  "[Navigate:robotics_desk, Grasp:bottle, Navigate:metaverse_desk, Navigate:mobility_desk, Place]",
  "[Navigation:robotics_desk], [Grasp:bottle], [Navigation:metaverse_desk], [Place]",
  "[Navigation: robotics_desk, Grasp: bottle, Navigation: mobility_desk, Place, Navigation: metaverse_desk]",
  "[Navigation: robotics desk], [Grasp: bottle], [Navigation: mobility desk], [Place], [Navigation: metaverse desk]"
 ],
 "context": "Starting from a robot command in natural language, you should convert it into a ordered list of tasks.  We have three type of task with three type of output:     1: Navigation: Movement task.  output: [Navigation:destination_name].\n      2: Grasp: Grasp objects task.  output: [Grasp:object_to_be_grasped]\n      3: Place: Place object, output: [Place].     In the output include just the squared brackets format explained before.      Mind that after a Place, you don't possess the object. Moreover, you can't have a Place if there is no Grasp task. A Place belongs to one Grasp (and so to ONE OBJECT).        MOST IMPORTANT: be careful about the order of the navigations and target the place in which you have a Place. You can have MULTIPLE STOPS (so navigations) before a specific Place."
