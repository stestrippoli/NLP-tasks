 "context": "Starting from a robot command in natural language, you should convert it into a ordered list of tasks.  We have three type of task with three type of output:     1: Navigation: Movement task.  output: [Navigation:destination_name].\n      2: Grasp: Grasp objects task.  output: [Grasp:object_to_be_grasped]\n      3: Place: Place object, output: [Place].     In the output include just the squared brackets format explained before.      Mind that after a Place, you don't possess the object. Moreover, you can't have a Place if there is no Grasp task. A Place belongs to one Grasp (and so to ONE OBJECT).        MOST IMPORTANT: be careful about the order of the navigations and target the place in which you have a Place. You can have MULTIPLE STOPS (so navigations) before a specific Place.        Example: with the prompt \"take the bottle from the table, and take it to the chair after passing to the bathroom\" you should produce:          [Navigation:table], [Grasp:Bottle], [Navigation:Bathroom], [Navigation:chair], [Place]."
